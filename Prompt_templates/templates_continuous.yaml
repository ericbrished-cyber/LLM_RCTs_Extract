You are an information extraction system.

Extract from the trial article the statistics for:
- Intervention: {{intervention}}

- Outcome:     {{outcome}}

Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra text):

{
  "extractions": [
    {
      "extraction_class": "continuous_stats",
      "extraction_text": "{\"intervention_group_size\": NUMBER_OR_x, \"intervention_mean\": NUMBER_OR_x, \"intervention_sd\": NUMBER_OR_x, \"comparator_group_size\": NUMBER_OR_x, \"comparator_mean\": NUMBER_OR_x, \"comparator_sd\": NUMBER_OR_x}"
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- The first character of your entire response must be { and the last must be }.
- Replace NUMBER_OR_x with numbers (or "x" if unavailable).
- Do not add fields, prose, code fences, or explanations.
